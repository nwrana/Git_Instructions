Instructions on How to work with Git and GitHub for version control
using Windows PowerShell

1. Create repo on Github

2. Open GitBash and type the following commands

Change your working directory to where your files are saved
cd "C:\Users\Nathan\Documents\Github\new location"

list files in new directory 
ls

Makes current directory a GIT repository
$ git init 

Check the status of the current GIT repository (i.e. files to be commited)
$ git status

Add version of files to be commited
$ git add sample_script.R

Commit to changes
$ git commit -m "insert message to describe changes"

Check remote origin master (where we are pushing versions to)
$ git remote -v

Change remote origin master if required
$ git remote rm origin #removes current master
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/nwrana/sample_script.git

You need to pull down changes from origin respository before pushing any changes 
$ git pull origin master

Push commit to master
$ git push origin master  

Try this if the first one doesn't work
git push -u origin master  

Exit PowerShell
Exit
